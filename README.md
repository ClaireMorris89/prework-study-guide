# Claire's Pre-Work Study Guide 

## Description

I wanted to build this webpage so I could have a central and organized hub for all of my learning materials throughout this course. As I update and add information, I'll be able to refer back to lessons in an efficient way. I learned how to write HTML and CSS, as well as add JavaScript to my webpage.

## Usage

To make this study guide easy to use, I added information on each important topic under it's own section (HTML, CSS, GIT, JAVASCRIPT). If you navigate to the console log, you can randomly generate a topic to start learning about first!

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
